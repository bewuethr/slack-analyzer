Slack analyzer is a GitHub Action to fetch all users from a Slack workspace and
determine when they joined and potentially left the workspace. This is used as
a proxy for tenure with a company.

The result is a README file with a graph showing turnover month over month, and
two Markdown tables showing when the current employees joined, and the tenures
of all employees ever. The README links to all relevant files.

Optionally, the action output can be used to send the latest diff and the graph
to a Telegram channel, using a separate action.

## Inputs

### `name`

**Required** The name of the workspace/company to be used in the output file
headings.

### `slack-bot-token`

**Required** A Slack API bot token with the `users:read` scope for the
workspace; this is required to fetch the list of users from the workspace.

### `slack-user-token`

**Required** A Slack API user token with the `search:read` scope for the
workspace; this is required to fetch the first and last message of a user.

## Outputs

### `diff-msg`

The latest diff in tenures, formatted for Telegram and JSON-escaped. Use
`fromJSON` to unescape. If there was no diff, the string is empty; this should
be checked before trying to use the diff.

### `graph-path`

The path to the PNG version of the turnover graph for usage in a Telegram
message (which does not support SVG). If no new graph was generated, the string
is empty; this should be checked before trying to use the graph in a message.

## Example usage

This includes the optional Telegram notifications.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Check out repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v2

  - name: Update Slack workspace analysis
    id: update
    uses: bewuethr/slack-analyzer@v0
    with:
      name: Foo Corp
      slack-bot-token: ${{ secrets.BOT_TOKEN }}
      slack-user-token: ${{ secrets.USER_TOKEN }}

  - name: Send Telegram message for change
    # Don't send message if there is no diff
    if: steps.update.outputs.diff-msg != ''
    uses: appleboy/telegram-action@v0.1.1
    with:
      to: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_TO }}
      token: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_TOKEN }}
      format: markdown
      message: ${{ fromJSON(steps.update.outputs.diff-msg) }}

  - name: Send Telegram message for graph
    # Don't send graph if it was not generated
    if: steps.update.outputs.graph-path != ''
    uses: appleboy/telegram-action@v0.1.1
    with:
      to: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_TO }}
      token: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_TOKEN }}
      photo: ${{ steps.update.outputs.graph-path }}
      # Required to avoid sending separate extra message
      message: ' '
```

## Assumptions

- An employee is assumed to have joined the company at the date of their first
  public Slack message
- They are assumed to have left the company at the date of their last public
  Slack message
- If somebody joins and leaves without ever posting a public message, they
  don't show up in the final table
- Employee numbers are assigned in ascending order of the timestamp of the
  first message; this isn't necessarily the true order, especially not for
  employees who joined before the company started using Slack &ndash; see
  `corrections.csv` below for a fix

## Slack API calls

- Get all users: [`users.list`][1]
- Find first/last message of a user: [`search.messages`][2], queried with
  `from:<@USERID>`; this means that the result depends on the user who owns the
  `USER_TOKEN` and which private channels they have access to

Calls to `search.messages` retry once on error; because curl respects the
`Retry-After` header, this slows down requests just enough when hitting the
rate limit.

## Generated files

- `README.md` contains the turnover graph and links to the other Markdown files
  and data sources
- `data/tenures.tsv` contains the tab-separated data for all users with Slack
  ID, name, title, status, and Unix timestamp of first and last message, where
  applicable; status can be one of
  - `active`: user is still active member of the workspace
  - `alum`: user is marked `deleted` and has a timestamp for their last message
  - `fresh`: user is active member of the workspace, but hasn't posted yet
  - `noshow`: user is marked `deleted` and never posted a message
- `data/corrections.csv` is an optional file containing corrections for known
  incorrect values; it uses four comma-separated columns:

  | Heading  | Meaning                                            |
  | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
  | `id`     | the ID of the user to which the correction applies |
  | `delete` | set to `true` if the user should be removed        |
  | `first`  | Unix timestamp for join date                       |
  | `last`   | Unix timestamp for departure date                  |

- `tenures.md` is the Markdown-formatted view of the `data/tenures.tsv` with
  no-shows removed, and human-readable datestamps, ordered by date of the first
  message
- `tenurescurrent.md` is the Markdown-formatted view of `tenures.tsv` with only
  current employees
- The `diffs/*.diff` files contain the unified diffs of the TSV data between
  two updates
- `data/turnover.tsv` is generated from `tenures.tsv` to be used as input for
  the script that generates the turnover graph; it is committed so it can serve
  as an indicator if the graph should be regenerated or not
- `turnover.svg` is the graph used in `README.md`
